## Data Security Categorization
The following categories are tiered so that every category is a subset of the following categories. 
For example, Personally Identifiable Information is also restricted by the guidelines set in Confidential Information, Internal Information, and Public Information. 
Likewise, Confidential Information is restricted by it's own guidelines, as well as the guidelines of Internal Information and Public Information. Confidential Information is not subject to the guidelines of PII.

1. Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
	* PII information includes any information that could be used to distinguish or trace an individuals identity. The following list is non-inclusive.
		* Name
		* SSN
		* Date and location of birth
		* Bio-metric records
	* Disclosure of PII must meet all guidelines of applicable laws. 
2. Confidential Information
	* Confidential Information is important or highly sensitive material. Generally confidential information is not linked to an individual.  The following list is non-inclusive
		* System Access Passwords
		* Encryption Keys
		* Sponsor Information
		* Financial Information
	* Access to confidential information has to be cleared by the information owner through Procedure (NumberNotDecided)
3. Internal Information
	* Internal Information is intended for unrestricted use inside of the the CCPSD system. In certain situations internal information may be shared with affiliated organizations as appropriate. Internal information requires no permission for distribution within the CCPSD system. The following list is non-inclusive.

    * Each school in the CCPSD system will have at least one designated authority to clear information as public.

## Operational Security
Host Security
* All computers will be tethered to the desk they rest on.
* All staff computers will reside in offices which are to be locked when not in use.
* All computers available for public use will be configured according to procedure(BLANK).
* All computers available for student use will be configured according to procedure(BLANK).
* All computers available for faculty use will be configured according to procedure(BLANK).
* Additional resources(software, ect) can be requested on a machine using procedure(BLANK).

Network Security
* All staff computers must connect to a secure network.
* Schools must provide private wireless access to its students and staff throughout the building. This network is not considered secure.
* Complete client isolation will be implimented on unsecure networks. Network resources will be exempt from this rule so they are available to all clients.
* Schools must provide wired ethernet ports in every staff office equal to the number of staff in that office. These will must be secure.
* Schools will configure their networks following procedure(BLANK).
* Schools will employ a firewall meeting criteria (BLANK) at the entrance to their network. This defense need not be diversified. The cost of diversification would be wasted on a network that is open in so many other areas.

## Security Awareness & Training
CCPSD, lead by the Information Security Officer (ISO) will ensure that:
* all students are reminded of cyber security principals in the beginning of any class where 80% of classtime is spent in a computer lab.
* all parents are annually reminded of cyber security principals.
* all staff not associated with IT attend an appropriate security training workshop at least once every two years.
* all staff associated with IT attend an appropriate security training workshop at least once every year.
* all staff responsible for storing (or maintaining services that store) Confidential or Personally Identifiable Information attend an appropriate security training workshop at least once every year. These individuals will also be responsible for keeping any required certifications up to date.

## Security Model
CCPSD uses the Clark-Wilson Security model. This model uses security classifications which are set up by the schools ISO based on job title. Special circumstances and access can be handled through procedure (BLANK). Different classifications have different network resource access permissions and access to different levels of data (PII, ect). Users must use correct procedures to modify data as in most cases direct interaction will not be permitted.
