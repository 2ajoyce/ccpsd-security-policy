# Central City Public School District Security Policy
## What is this?
This is security policy for a fictional school that I created as a homework assignment.
## Tell me more?
This policy is being created as a semester long assigment for the class COMP_SCI 5601 at Missouri University of Science and Technology.
The school district does not actually exist and these policies are not intended for actual use.
## Can I use this?
For a variety of reasons I recommend that this document is used only as an inspirational reference. It was never intended to see actual real world use and it was designed around that assumption.
